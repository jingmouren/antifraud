# AntiFraud
A Credit Card Fraud Detection Framework.

Source codes implementation of papers:
- AAAI2020: Spatio-temporal attention-based neural network for credit card fraud detection
- ICONIP2016: Credit card fraud detection using convolutional neural networks


## Usage

#### Packaging
Git clone this repository, go to the home folder of *antifraud*, run: 

     python setup.py sdist

Pip installable package will be generated in dist/*.tar.gz
#### Install

Simply run below command:

    pip install ./dist/antifraud-0.1.0.tar.gz


#### General Options

You can check out the other options available to use with *Ternary* using:

     python -m antifraud --help

- --method, the processing method, includes: logistic, Adamboost, GBDT, LSTM, cnn,
                                 cnn-att-2d, cnn-att-3d, etc.
- --trainfeature, train feature data
- --trainlabel, train label data
- --testfeature, test feature data
- --testlabel, test label data


#### Example
Generate annotator command:

     python -m antifraud --method GBDT --train data/train.csv --test data/test.csv

#### Data Description

Most credit card transaction data are confidential and canâ€™t be used as examples on the package. So we provide 20 simulated records (*data/example_data.csv*) for readers to run our code. You can feed the example data directly to --train or/and --test command.

- is_fraud;  0 denotes legitimate transactions and 1 means fraud transactions.
- card_id; unique ID for credit card cardholders. 
- time_stamp; the transaction time.
- loc_cty; the transaction location. 
- loc_merch; the merchant (receiver) of the transaction.  
- amt_grant; the granted transaction amount.  
- amt_purch; the issued transaction amount.
